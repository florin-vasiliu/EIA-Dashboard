## Background and Motivation:

Inspired to make sense of all the information and stories about energy trends in the United States, our group decided to use data provided by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to create a single, consolidated dashboard to answer the following questions:

Q1: What is the USA total energy consumption/production by source?
(Source: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=711239)

Q2: Which energy source does each state use/produce the most?
(Source: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=40203)

Q3: What is the average retail price of electricity by state and sector?
(Source: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=40)

Q4: What is the average retail price of oil and gas by state and sector?
(Source: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=241020)

## Agenda:

1. Development:

a. Tools Used
 - Python (requests, pandas, numpy, flask)
 - JavaScript (plotly, chart.js)
 - MongoDB Atlas
 - Amazon Web Services
 
b. data streaming: EIA site -> data clean-up -> db update -> plot generation -> publishing

2. Energy sources breakdown and evolution by time

3. Renewable energy sources breakdown by state

4. Electricity prices

5. Emissions and gas prices
